# Actions on Google Name Psychic Sample using Node.js

The Psychic in this sample can guess interesting secrets about you, like your
name and where you are. This sample introduces permissions requests for user
information on the Actions on Google platform.

## Setup Instructions

1. In your Project settings, under Service Accounts, download a private key.
